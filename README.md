# Library For WordPress
WordPress library which supports a core plugin and theme.
Currently in bleeding edge alpha.

This is the next iteration of the mvc family. The world is moving toward having most development done in a core plugin instead of the theme. The days where having a MVC structure theme was awesome are coming to an end. mvc-remix had a good run and was the backbone to a ton of amazing projects. Now it's time to say goodbye and move toward a formal library structure.

Welcome Lipe Libs, all the tools of mvc-remix without the MVC.
